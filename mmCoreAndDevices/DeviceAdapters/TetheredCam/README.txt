KH 20110104
Project files corrected so that correct device adapter dll files are built for Release.

KDV 20110114 Bugfix: ROI was wrong if ROI button clicked twice in succession. Code cleanup.

KDV 20110117 Bugfix: ROI was wrong if both binning and ROI changed in same snap

KDV 20110209 8/16 bit colors added; raw image decoding through libraw added.

Steps taken to add libraw to the VC++ project:
- download LibRaw-0.13.1.zip from http://www.libraw.org, unzip.
- remove version number from directory name, changing directory name to "LibRaw"
- add to project:
  from directory LibRaw\internal:
    dcraw_common.cpp  dcraw_fileio.cpp  demosaic_packs.cpp
  from directory LibRaw\src:
    libraw_c_api.cpp  libraw_cxx.cpp
- to project>properties>configuration properties>c/c++>additional include directories:
    add LibRaw
- to project>properties>configuration properties>c/c++>preprocessor>preprocessor definitions:
    add LIBRAW_NODLL
- select files:
    dcraw_common.cpp  dcraw_fileio.cpp  demosaic_packs.cpp  libraw_c_api.cpp  libraw_cxx.cpp
  right click and set properties>configuration properties>c/c++>warning level to "Off (/W0)"
- choose configuration: "Release"
  select files:
    dcraw_common.cpp  dcraw_fileio.cpp  demosaic_packs.cpp  libraw_c_api.cpp  libraw_cxx.cpp
  right click and set properties>configuration properties>c/c++>optimization> "Maximize speed (/O2)"
  and properties>configuration properties>c/c++>code generation>enable c++ exceptions> "Yes (/EHsc)"

  This corresponds to the settings in LibRaw/Makefile.msvc for libraw_static (/EHsc /O2 /W0 /DLIBRAW_NODLL)

KDV 20121024 Upgraded to LibRaw-0.14.7
