Notes on the GigE Camera Adapter for micro-manager:

- Users will need to install the JAI, Inc., SDK and control tool from:
http://www.jai.com/EN/CameraSolutions/Download/Pages/JAI_SDK_and_control_tool.aspx

- The following features are unimplemented:
-- Packed, Planar and RGB image formats.
-- ROI features requiring anything from the device adapter itself.
